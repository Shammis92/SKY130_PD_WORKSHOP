# RTL2GDS flow steps

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110658068/183242250-787dec77-1b0b-4f8f-b4cc-506d013b965e.png)

    -Synthesis :- In logic synthesis, a high-level description of the design (RTL Code) is converted into an optimized gate-level representation of a given standard cell library and certain design constraints.
    
    -Floorplanning :- determines the shapes and arrangement of sub-circuits or modules, as well as the locations of external ports and IP or macro-blocks.
   
    -Power and ground routing (power planning) :- often intrinsic to floorplanning, distributes power (VDD) and ground (GND) nets throughout the chip.
    
    -Placement :-finds the spatial locations of all cells within each block and place the all cells in the design.
    
    -Clock Tree Synthesis(CTS) :- determines the buffering, gating (e.g., for power management) and routing of the clock signal to meet prescribed skew and delay requirements.
    
    -Global routing :- allocates routing resources that are used for connections; example resources include routing tracks in the channel and in the switch box.
    
    -Detailed routing :- assigns routes to specific metal layers and routing tracks within the global routing resources.
    
    -sign-off :- If there are some timing violations in post route design, we have a further stage called ECO (Engineering Change Order) where we can fix the timing violations. Apart from timing violation, there may be issues like IR Drop, DRC Violations all these are fixed in this stage and a final layout file   free from all the violation is streamed out in GDSII format. This process is known as tapeout in ASIC flow.
# whole OpenLane ASIC flow

# Getting started with OpenLane flow and setup to run the whole flow 

1) initial Window once the LINUX terminal is opened

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110658068/183243055-7d6e73e9-dc99-42b8-b2df-679e842dab75.png)

2) All the PDK's data stored in the directory ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks
        - open_pdks
        - sky130A
        - skywater-pdk
3) All the runs need to be fired in the directory ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110658068/183243261-e497d5d7-23a1-47ff-a33d-8dd6d0960b0d.png)

4) steps to evoke the tool
     1) go to the directory ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
     2) type command docker
     3) type ./flow.tcl -interactive
     4) type package require opnelane 0.9 (to import all the packages require to run the flow)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110658068/183243553-6a86610e-4232-4047-b354-88ac5cf31561.png)

5) the design on which we will work is picorv32a and all the settings or configurations file related to the design stored in
      1) ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a
      2) there are two configuration files present under the above directory config.tcl and sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl which 
      have all the settings required to create the desired design
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110658068/183243740-d19d593d-e49b-4d3d-807b-8cb8518ae96c.png)

6) Preparing the system to run all the steps from synthesis to routing by using
     1) prep -design picorv32a -tag <tag_name>
     2) this step will fetch all the files required to run the whole RTL2GDS flow
     
     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110658068/183243941-9d950ffa-343f-4198-a30b-71dbbfca6b64.png)
  
 7) After successful preparation we can go for first step in the design which is synthesis
     1) type command run_syntheis
     
     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110658068/183244358-898a36b3-78aa-44e3-9336-e7cc8cafaded.png)

     2) during the sythesis process tool will create the gate level netlist which we can further use in other steps of design
     3) netlist is present in the directory 
        ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/run_08_06_2022/results/synthesis/picorv32a.synthesis.v
     4) reports for the synthesis present in the directory 
        ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/run_08_06_2022/reports/synthesis/2-opensta.timing.rpt

8) flop ratio can be calculated after the synthesis by (total number of flops)/(total number of cells)
 
# Day2 - Undestand importance of good floorplan vs Bad floorplan and introduction to library cells

mostly focusing on the floorplan constraints, concept of decoupling cells, power planning and finally performing the floorplan and reviewing the floorplan in magic 

1)For defining width and height of CORE and DIE

      a.	Dimensions of standard cells is crucial part, and the number of standard cells present in the design 
      
      b.	So, these values can be pre-estimated based on the amount of logic present in the design 
      
      c.	Two terminologies are used for dimension of the design utilization factor and aspect ratio
      
      d.	Utilization_factor = (Area occupied by netlist)/(Total area of the core)
      
      e.	Aspect_ratio = (height of die/width of die)

2)	Preplaced cells: - these are the cells which are manually placed by the designer during the floor planning, after the placement of these cells these cells are not touched in later stage of the design

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110658068/183250851-46518b44-432f-4394-b7bf-61041de08402.png)

3)	Need for decoupling capacitance:- A decoupling capacitor is a capacitor, which is used decouple the critical cells from main power supply, in order to protect the cells from the disturbance occurring in the power distribution lines and source

4)	Power planning: - Power planning means to provide power to every macros, standard cells, and all other cells are present in the design

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110658068/183250881-b753cfdb-38a1-4fc5-b2ca-94f5a20aedb9.png)
